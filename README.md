# Data Structure Practice
These are sets of code that I wrote to practice data structure

There are 2 fields for each problems. A .txt file and a .py file. The .txt is to practice without IDE and the .py is saved wile testing them on IDE. 

## reverse_string_recursive: ##
_This is a way to reverse a string recursively. For example Input -> "Hello World" will be Output -> "dlroW olleH"
Testing done using the python reverse([::-1]) to check against_


## permute_recursively: ##
_This is the implementation of find the permutation of a string recursively. Example, for string "ABC" it will return all the possible combinations ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']_

## min_coin_recursive: ##
_This is the recursive implementation of the popular minimum coin finding problem. For example it the amount is 10 and we have a list of [1,5,10] coins. It will find the min number of coins required to make that amount. In this case it is a coin of 10. So, it will return 1_

## min_coin_recursive_memoization: ##
_This is the solution of min_coin_recursive but includes memoization. __Memoization__ is the process of storing data in cache so that we don't have a recalculate things. While it takes some space it saves a lots of time and processing_


## Trees: ##
### Binary Tree: ###
_This is the implementation of Binary tree with a class. The __binary_tree_traversal__ is used to traverse the binary tree_

### Binary Min Heap: ###
_This is the implementation of __Binary Min Heap__ with a class. The __testing_binary_min_heap__ is used to test the __Binary Min Heap___
