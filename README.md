# Data Structure Practice
These are sets of code that I wrote to practice data structure

There are 2 fiels for each problems. A .txt file and a .py file. The .txt is to practice without IDE and the .py is saved wile testing them on IDE. 

#reverse_string_recursive
This is a way to reverse a string recursively. For example Input -> "Hello World" will be Output -> "dlroW olleH"
Testing done using the python reverse([::-1]) to check against

#permute_recursively
This is the implementation of find the permutation of a string recursively. Example, for string "ABC" it will return all the possible combinations ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']
