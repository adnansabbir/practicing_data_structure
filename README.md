# Data Structure Practice
These are sets of code that I wrote to practice data structure

There are 2 fields for each problems. A .txt file and a .py file. The .txt is to practice without IDE and the .py is saved wile testing them on IDE. 

## reverse_string_recursive: ##
*This is a way to reverse a string recursively. For example Input -> "Hello World" will be Output -> "dlroW olleH"
Testing done using the python reverse([::-1]) to check against*

**permute_recursively: **
*This is the implementation of find the permutation of a string recursively. Example, for string "ABC" it will return all the possible combinations ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA'] *

**min_coin_recursive: **
*This is the recursive implementation of the popular minimum coin finding problem. For example it the amount is 10 and we have a list of [1,5,10] coins. It will find the min number of coins required to make that amount. In this case it is a coin of 10. So, it will return 1*
